[![Hackage Version](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/tasty-hedgehog-lens.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-hedgehog-lens)

Preassembled [`tasty`][tasty] `TestTree`s for validation of the properties of lenses
with some help from [`hedgehog`][hedgehog].

Inspired by [`tasty-lens`][tasty-lens] and uses [`lens-laws`][lens-laws] under the hood.
